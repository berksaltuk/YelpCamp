# YelpCamp
- YelpCamp is a complete web application runs on Heroku server and developed by using Express.js, Node.js, EJS, HTML&CSS and Bootstrap. The application uses MongoDB as the database. 
- This application was coded from scratch by me based on Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp course on Udemy.
